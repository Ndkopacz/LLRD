                        intend to attend grad school for machine learning.</p>

                    <p>I am majoring in electrical engineering with an expected graduation date of May 2025. 
                        I'm very interested in furthering my understanding of mechatronics and hardware design/implementation, 
                        honing my skills through different software interfaces. Currently I'm seeking opportunities to 
                        gain practical experience in my field, but my involvement in this project as well as personal 
                        projects continue to push me forward.

                        I am majoring in engineering science and graduating in May 2025. My academic projects are in passive radar
                        and electron cloud modeling. I plan on using this degree and my experience to do some multidisciplinary 
                        work, perhaps in project management. We'll see what the future brings!
